1)Yes, it would have been possible to avoid code repetition by consolidating similar functions into a single file, rather than writing each function in a separate file. For instance, the code for the `max` and `min` functions could have been implemented in the same file. Additionally, the code for validating the `scanf` format specifier could have been repurposed. This approach would have led to more efficient and structured code, as it would have diminished code duplication and facilitated the code's maintenance and updates.
2)We wrote a script in Bash that generates a text file containing 5,000 numbers generated by a command. We then inputted the file into the "hist" program and determined that the scores we randomly generated in the command are uniformly distributed.
